## Payload
```js
{
    // required
    collection: string;
    external_id: string;
    context_id: Id;
}
```
## Returns
```js
{
    id: Id;
}
```
in the case one id is found.
```js
{
    id: null;
    error: string;
}
```
else.

## Logic

It should be search for an `external_id` in the given collection (`group`, `meeting` or `committee`) in the respective context. `context_id` must point to the respective parent object: if the collection is `group`, this must be the `meeting_id`, for `meeting` it is the `committee_id` and for `committee` it must be `1` for the `orgnization_id`. If one id is found, return the id, else return an error and and `null` for the id.

Following error cases could be encountered: "No item with 'external_id' was found" and "More then one item with 'external_id' were found".

For searching a user by `saml_id` see [search_users](search_users.md).
