    pollmethod: string,
    min_votes_amount: number,
    max_votes_amount: number,
    max_votes_per_option: number,

}
```

## Action
For analog polls: If the state is created and at least one vote value is given (`votesvalid`/`votesinvalid`/`votescast`), the state is set to finished. If additionally `publish_immediately` is given, the state is set to published.

For electronic polls some fields can only be updated, if the state is *created*.

The `entitled_group_ids` may not contain the meetings `anonymous_group_id`.

The `max_votes_per_option` and `min_votes_amount` must be smaller or equal to `max_votes_amount` after the model has been updated.

## Permissions
The request user needs:
- `motion.can_manage_polls` if the poll's content object is a motion
- `assignment.can_manage` if the poll's content object is an assignment
- `poll.can_manage` if the poll's content object is a topic
