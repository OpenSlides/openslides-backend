## Action
Updates a user.
* The field `organization_management_level` can only be set as high as the request users `organization_management_level`. A user cannot withdraw/change his own OML "superadmin" or set himself inactive.
* The `username` must be unique within all users. It may not contain spaces.
* The `organization_management_level` as replacement can be taken from the enum of the field user.organization_management_level.
* Remove starting and trailing spaces from `username`, `first_name` and `last_name`
* The given `gender` must be present in `organization/genders`
* The `member_number` must be unique within all users.
* Will throw an error if the `group_ids` contain the meetings `anonymous_group_id`.
* The action checks, whether at the end the field `locked_out` will be set together with any of `user.can_manage` or any admin statuses on the updated user and throws an error if that is the case.

Note: `is_present_in_meeting_ids` is not available in update, since there is no possibility to partially update this field. This can be done via [user.set_present](user.set_present.md).

If the user is removed from all groups of the meeting, all his unstarted speakers in that meeting will be deleted.

If the user was the last member of the meetings admin group and he happens to be removed from the latter through this action, as long as the meeting is not a template, there will be an error.

## Permissions
If the OML of the request user is lower than the OML of the user to update, only meeting-specific fields (groups B and C) are allowed to be changed. If any other fields are present in the payload, the request must fail.
If the user to be updated has a `saml_id`, the fields `can_change_own_password` and
`default_password` may not be set, because the user is a SingleSignOn user. If the saml_id will be set, the fields `default_password` and `password` will be set empty and `can_change_own_password` will be set to `False`.

Group A:

See [Permissions for altering a user](https://github.com/OpenSlides/OpenSlides/wiki/Users#Permissions-for-altering-a-user).

Group B:

The request user needs `user.can_update` in each referenced meeting.

Group C:

For each meeting the request user must satisfy at least one of:
- `user.can_manage` for the meeting, OR
- If the meeting is not locked via `locked_from_inside` setting:
  * the OML `can_manage_users` in the organization
  * The CML `can_manage` for the committee of the meeting

Group D:

The request user must satisfy at least one of:
- the OML `can_manage_users`
- the CML `can_manage` for each referenced committee

Group E:

The request user needs the OML equal or higher than that he wants to set. So the minimum is `can_manage_users`.

Group F:

The request user needs the permissions under the rules of user_scope, see [Permissions for altering a user](https://github.com/OpenSlides/OpenSlides/wiki/Users#Permissions-for-altering-a-user), but at minimum the OML of the requested user.

Group G:

The request user needs the OML `superadmin`.

Group H:

Group H fields are only allowed in internal requests
